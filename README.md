## Differences between this clone and the official HP board

- R411, R412 and R414 footprints have been removed to allow more room for X411, X412 and X414, which now support Vishay (0.15" lead spacing) foil resistors (including the hermetically sealed variants such as VHP202Z) or AE (0.2" lead spacing) foil resistors.
- An additional footprint which combines X411 and X412 has been added, supporting the Vishay VHD200 voltage dividers.
- This board is slightly shorter than the HP board, and fits within a 50x50mm square (which is the cheapest pricing tier for many PCB manufacturers).
